Presentation notes:
---

Application domain:

DONE


User tasks:

DONE


InfoVis elements:

- TR for layout
  * bottom rooted
  * no links
  * discuss other implementation things, or leave in technology section?
- F+C: relationship between focus and its children and parent (check in source paper)
- colour:
  * highlight focused node and related nodes
  * categorizing nodes (e.g. children, visited) (attention on visually separated elements)


Design sketches:

DONE


Technology:

DONE


Discussion:

DONE





Proposal notes:
---


Reading review:

(possibly copy some to infovis elements, remainder likely to future work)

- Herman et al. paper: techniques for visualizing trees
  * TR algorithm: visually rooted tree, unlike other space-saving layouts;
    + proof tree drawings must adhere to a specific structure
    + inverted so root is at the bottom
    + TR vertically aligns nodes at the same depth in a proof
  * incremental exploration and navigation to display only a subtree (future work)
  * focus+context?
- Ware: colour in visualization
  * used to highlight focused node
  * in proof walk-through, explain and justify colouring of nodes in past, colouring of children
    + want reader to focus mostly on focused node, slightly on future, not at all on past
- Figueiras taxonomy of interaction
  * we use abstract/elaborate (future), select, overview/explore
- Duval discussion of opinions on visualizations
  * interaction elevates visualization to provide comprehension, etc
- Lin and Yang facets of proof comprehension
- Yie et al. on processes for gaining insight
  * discuss how each process leads to insight in this project


Problem domain:

DONE


Use of visualization:

DONE


Design outline (approach):

- description of inference rules (for intro or logic background or conclusion)
- sequent
- in TR algorithm, can depend on root of tree being in the same location (in InfoVis Elements section)

(possibly copy some paragraphs?)


Design outline (technology):

DONE
